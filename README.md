## Financial Modeling & Valuation of Bajaj Auto Ltd -

This project involves a **comprehensive financial modeling and valuation analysis of Bajaj Auto Ltd**, aimed at understanding the company’s financial performance, risk profile, and intrinsic value using both **fundamental and advanced valuation techniques**.

### 1. Financial Statement Analysis

Historical **Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement** were prepared and analyzed to study revenue growth, cost structure, profitability, liquidity, and cash generation ability of Bajaj Auto. Special emphasis was given to operating efficiency, margin trends, and free cash flow generation.

### 2. Forecasting & Projections

A **forward-looking financial model** was developed by forecasting key components such as revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, working capital, and capital expenditure. Forecasts were based on historical trends, industry dynamics, and reasonable growth assumptions to project future financial performance.

### 3. Ratio Analysis

A detailed **ratio analysis** was conducted covering:

* **Profitability ratios** (Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, ROE, ROA)
* **Liquidity ratios** (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio)
* **Efficiency ratios** (Asset Turnover, Inventory Turnover)
* **Solvency ratios** (Debt-Equity, Interest Coverage)

This helped assess Bajaj Auto’s operational strength, financial stability, and capital efficiency.

### 4. Common Size Statements

**Common-size income statement and balance sheet** were prepared to analyze cost structure, expense behavior, and asset composition as a percentage of total revenue and total assets, enabling easy comparison across years.

### 5. Risk Analysis – Beta & WACC

* **Beta** was calculated to measure Bajaj Auto’s systematic risk relative to the market.
* **Cost of Equity** was estimated using the **CAPM model**.
* **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)** was computed by combining the cost of equity and after-tax cost of debt, serving as the discount rate for valuation models.

### 6. Valuation Analysis

#### a) Relative Valuation

Bajaj Auto was valued using **market multiples** such as:

* P/E Ratio
* EV/EBITDA
* P/B Ratio

These were compared with industry peers to determine whether the stock is relatively overvalued or undervalued.

#### b) Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Valuation

A **DCF valuation** was performed by:

* Estimating **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)**
* Discounting future cash flows using WACC
* Calculating terminal value using the growth method

The intrinsic value obtained was compared with the current market price to assess investment attractiveness.

### 7. DuPont Analysis

**DuPont Analysis** was used to break down **Return on Equity (ROE)** into:

* Net Profit Margin
* Asset Turnover
* Financial Leverage

This provided deeper insight into the drivers of shareholder returns.

### 8. Financial Distress Analysis – Altman Z-Score

The **Altman Z-Score model** was applied to evaluate Bajaj Auto’s financial health and bankruptcy risk. The results indicated strong solvency and a low probability of financial distress.

### 9. Advanced Corporate Finance Models

#### a) LBO (Leveraged Buyout) Model

An **LBO model** was constructed to evaluate the feasibility of acquiring Bajaj Auto using significant debt financing. The model analyzed:

* Debt repayment capacity
* Cash flow sufficiency
* Equity IRR for financial sponsors

#### b) Merger & Acquisition (M&A) Model

An **M&A model** was developed to assess potential acquisition scenarios, including:

* Synergy analysis
* Accretion/Dilution impact on EPS
* Combined financial projections

This helped evaluate the strategic and financial impact of a merger or acquisition involving Bajaj Auto.
